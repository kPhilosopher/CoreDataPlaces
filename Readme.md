Demo Applications
===
These projects were initiated by the Stanford Universityâ€™s CS193P, [iPhone Application Development class](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/downloads-2010-fall). There are __two__ projects, in __three__ repositories. 

![Workflow](https://github.com/kPhilosopher/CoreDataPlaces/raw/master/Readme/workflow_of_repo.png


[GraphCalculator](https://github.com/kPhilosopher/graphCalculator_test) was the first project. GraphCalculator is a simple two screen application that allowed me to dip my toes into Objective-C and iOS application development. This project gave me a glimpse to the syntax of Objective-C, Xcode, and the cocoa framework.

[Places](https://github.com/kPhilosopher/Places) and [CoreDataPlaces](https://github.com/kPhilosopher/CoreDataPlaces) were completed after the GraphCalculator. The main difference between the two part project is the mechanism of persistance. Places uses NSUserDefaults while CoreDataPlaces uses Core Data. Whilst following the lectures supplied by Stanford, I also attempted to experiment with the suggestions detailed in *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* and *The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master*.

Core Data Places
---

The CoreDataPlaces application allows the user to navigate through the recent pictures taken in the top places designated by Flickr. The [Flickr API](https://github.com/kPhilosopher/CoreDataPlaces/blob/master/CoreDataPlaces/Flickr/FlickrFetcher.h) is provided by Stanford. The specifications to this assignment can be found on the [CS193P page](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/downloads-2010-fall). 

CoreDataPlaces is constituted with five custom UITableViewControllers and one UIViewController with UIScrollView as its main view. These controllers reside in UINavigationControllers and a custom UITabBarController allowing navigation between the model-view-controllers (MVC). The five custom UITableViewController are subclasses of [CPIndexedViewController](https://github.com/kPhilosopher/CoreDataPlaces/blob/master/CoreDataPlaces/IndexedTableMVC/CPIndexedTableViewController.h). There are three tabs with Top, Most Recents, and Favorites. CPIndexedViewController utilizes three strategy objects and subclassing to optimize code reuse.
